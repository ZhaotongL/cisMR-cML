# cisMRcML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cisMRcML is to perform robust (to horizontal pleiotropy)
cis-Mendelian randomization using gene expression or protein as the
exposure.
<!-- More detail is coming, but if you want to try it out first, feel free to contact me at zl23k@fsu.edu.  -->

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZhaotongL/cisMRcML")
```

## Usage

The [vignette](https://github.com/ZhaotongL/cisMRcML/main/vignettes/Vignette.html) will provide a good start point for cis Mendelian randomization analysis using cisMRcML package.

## Reference 

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
