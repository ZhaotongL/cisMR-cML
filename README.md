# cisMRcML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cisMRcML is to perform robust (to horizontal pleiotropy)
cis-Mendelian randomization using gene expression or protein as the
exposure.

## Installation

cisMRcML can be used on any operating system. R needs to be installed. Package ``devtools`` is required for the installation. The installation would take a minute or so.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZhaotongL/cisMRcML")
```


## Usage

The [vignette](http://rpubs.com/ZhaotongL/cisMRcML_vignette) will provide a good start point for cis Mendelian randomization analysis using cisMRcML package.

The software has been tested on MacOS 14.3 and R version 3.6.3.

## Reference 

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
