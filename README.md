# cisMRcML

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cisMRcML is to perform robust (to horizontal pleiotropy)
cis-Mendelian randomization using gene expression or protein as the
exposure. More detail is coming, but if you want to try it out first,
feel free to contact me at <zl23k@fsu.edu>.

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub. -->
